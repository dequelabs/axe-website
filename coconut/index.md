To make it easy for everyone to test the leading edge of axe-core, weâ€™ve introduced a **new free Chrome extension**, called aXe Coconut. It includes our latest code changes, with experimental rules also enabled. The aXe Coconut extension, created in the same vein as a Chrome Canary or Firefox Nightly, will allow you to try out our latest APIs and rules before they are released to more stable channels, such as our regular aXe Chrome Extension.
